## AWS Amplify Next.js (App Router) Starter Template

This repository provides a starter template for creating applications using Next.js (App Router) and AWS Amplify, emphasizing easy setup for authentication, API, and database capabilities.

## Overview

This template equips you with a foundational Next.js application integrated with AWS Amplify, streamlined for scalability and performance. It is ideal for developers looking to jumpstart their project with pre-configured AWS services like Cognito, AppSync, and DynamoDB.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Setup with Amazon Cognito for secure user authentication.
- **API**: Ready-to-use GraphQL endpoint with AWS AppSync.
- **Database**: Real-time database powered by Amazon DynamoDB.

## Getting Started

### Configure Cognito User Pool

Before running the application, you need to set up your Amazon Cognito User Pool:

1. Create a User Pool in the AWS Console if you don't have one already
2. Create an app client for your application
3. Configure the environment variables:

Create or edit the `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your Cognito User Pool details:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_USER_POOL_ID=your-user-pool-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=your-user-pool-client-id
```

### Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploying to AWS

For detailed instructions on deploying your application, refer to the [deployment section](https://docs.amplify.aws/nextjs/start/quickstart/nextjs-app-router-client-components/#deploy-a-fullstack-app-to-aws) of our documentation.
